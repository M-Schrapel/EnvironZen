# EnvironZen: Augmented Footstep Sounds in Relaxing Soundscapes

![Teaser Image](/Images/app_view.jpg)

EnvironZen is an Android app developed to investigate augmented footstep sounds in the wild. For this purpose, accelerometer data from the smartphone are used to augment footsteps in a virtual soundscape. The advantage is that no additional equipment (e.g. sensors on the shoes) is required. The user only has to put on his headphones and start the app. After putting the smartphone in his pocket, the user can explore a virtual, relaxing soundscape in a real environment. 

## Installation

In the folder App is already a compiled .apk that can be installed on the smartphone. Alternatively, in the folder Code the corresponding Android Studio project can be found. 

## Usage

Open the app and swipe to the right or left to select a desired soundscape. Now start the augmentation by swiping up and putting your smartphone in your pocket. You can stop the augmentation by swiping down again.
